#   The maximum range of valid temperatures (in Celsius) that the
#   sensor must remain within. This controls a safety feature
#   implemented in the micro-controller code - should the measured
#   temperature ever fall outside this range then the micro-controller
#   will go into a shutdown state. Set this range just wide enough so
#   that reasonable temperatures do not result in an error. These
#   parameters must be provided.
